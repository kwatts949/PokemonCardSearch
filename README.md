# Spec

A very simple app built for my son, who is a Pokemon Card game fanatic. He is always asking how much certain cards are, so that he can expand his collection. I wanted to create a safe environment for him to check card prices and see certain information about each card.
  
The app uses fetch requests to retrieve card data information. I have also built in a currency converter which fetches current exchange rate data to convert EUR to GBP so that prices are displayed in the appropriate currency.
